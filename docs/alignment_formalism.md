# Aligning convex hulls

That's a fascinating problem involving the geometric alignment of convex hulls! Here's a breakdown of a potential formalism, combining concepts from linear algebra, computational geometry, and rigid body transformations.

**Core Idea:** We'll use a series of rigid body transformations (rotations and translations) to achieve the desired alignment.

**Step 1: Representing Convex Hulls**

First, we need a way to represent our convex hulls. A common approach is to store them as a collection of their vertices. Let's say:

* Convex Hull 1 ($\mathcal{H}_1$) has vertices $\{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}, ..., v_{1,n_1}\}$.
* Convex Hull 2 ($\mathcal{H}_2$) has vertices $\{v_{2,1}, v_{2,2}, ..., v_{2,n_2}\}$.

Each $v_{i,j}$ is a 3D vector $[x, y, z]^T$.

**Step 2: Aligning and Orienting the First Convex Hull ($\mathcal{H}_1$)**

1.  **Centering at the Origin (Optional but often helpful):**
- Calculate the centroid (geometric center) of $\mathcal{H}_1$:

$$
c_1 = \frac{1}{n_1} \sum_{i=1}^{n_1} v_{1,i}
$$

- Translate all vertices of $\mathcal{H}_1$ by $-c_1$:

$$
v'_{1,i} = v_{1,i} - c_1
$$

- Now, the centroid of the transformed $\mathcal{H}_1$ (let's call it $\mathcal{H}'_1$) is at the origin.

2.  **Orienting $\mathcal{H}'_1$ (Specifying a Direction):**
- You need to define a target orientation for $\mathcal{H}'_1$. This could be based on:
- **A specific face normal:** If you want a particular face of $\mathcal{H}'_1$ to align with a world axis (e.g., its normal pointing along the positive z-axis). You'd need to compute the face normals of $\mathcal{H}'_1$.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** You could align the principal axes of $\mathcal{H}'_1$'s point cloud with the world axes. This provides a canonical orientation based on the data's spread.
- **Alignment with specific vertices or edges:** You might want a specific edge to be parallel to an axis or two specific vertices to lie in a particular plane.

- Let's assume you've chosen a target orientation defined by a rotation matrix $R_1$. This matrix will rotate $\mathcal{H}'_1$ such that its chosen feature aligns with the desired direction.
- Apply the rotation to all vertices of $\mathcal{H}'_1$:

$$
v''_{1,i} = R_1 v'_{1,i}
$$

- Now, we have an oriented version of the first convex hull, $\mathcal{H}''_1$. If you skipped the centering step, $v''_{1,i} = R_1 (v_{1,i} - c_1)$. If you didn't center, and want to anchor a specific vertex to the origin later, you'd perform a translation.

**Step 3: Aligning the Second Convex Hull ($\mathcal{H}_2$) to a Face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$**

1.  **Identify the Target Face on $\mathcal{H}''_1$:**
- You need a way to specify the face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$ you want to align with. This could be done by:
- **Indices of the vertices forming the face.**
- **The equation of the plane containing the face (normal vector and a point on the plane).**

2.  **Determine the Corresponding Features on $\mathcal{H}_2$:**
- You also need to identify the part of $\mathcal{H}_2$ that should align with the chosen face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$. This could be:
- **A face of $\mathcal{H}_2$ (defined by its vertices).**
- **A set of vertices on $\mathcal{H}_2$ that should lie on or near the plane of the target face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$.**

3.  **Compute the Alignment Transformation:**
- This is the most complex part and depends on what exactly needs to be aligned (a face to a face, vertices to a face, etc.). Here are a few scenarios:

- **Aligning a Face of $\mathcal{H}_2$ to a Face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$:**
- **Compute the plane equation of the target face on $\mathcal{H}''_1$:** Given three non-collinear vertices $p_1, p_2, p_3$ of the face, the normal vector $n_1 = (p_2 - p_1) \times (p_3 - p_1)$ (normalize it). A point on the plane is $p_1$. The equation is $n_1 \cdot (x - p_1) = 0$.
- **Compute the plane equation of the corresponding face on $\mathcal{H}_2$:** Similarly, find the normal vector $n_2$ and a point $q_1$ on the face.
- **Rotation to align the normals:** Find a rotation $R_2$ that aligns $n_2$ with $n_1$. This can be done using techniques like Rodrigues' rotation formula or by finding the rotation matrix that maps one vector to another.
- **Translation to bring the faces into contact:** After rotation, you need to translate $\mathcal{H}_2$ so that a point on its aligned face ($R_2 q_1$) coincides with a point on the target face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$ ($p_1$). The translation vector would be $t = p_1 - R_2 q_1$.
- The transformation for $\mathcal{H}_2$ would be $v'_{2,i} = R_2 v_{2,i} + t$.

- **Aligning Vertices of $\mathcal{H}_2$ to the Plane of a Face on $\mathcal{H}''_1$:**
- Compute the plane equation of the target face on $\mathcal{H}''_1$ (normal $n_1$, point $p_1$).
- You might want to find a rigid transformation (rotation $R_2$ and translation $t$) for $\mathcal{H}_2$ that minimizes the distances of the chosen vertices of $\mathcal{H}_2$ to the plane. This could involve a least-squares optimization approach.

- **Aligning Specific Vertices of $\mathcal{H}_2$ to Specific Vertices of the Target Face on $\mathcal{H}''_1$:**
- If you have a one-to-one correspondence between a set of vertices on $\mathcal{H}_2$ and a set of vertices on the target face of $\mathcal{H}''_1$, you can try to find the rigid transformation that maps these corresponding points as closely as possible. This is a point cloud registration problem, and algorithms like the Horn's method (using quaternions) can be used to find the optimal rotation and translation.

**Step 4: Combining Transformations**

The final transformation applied to the vertices of $\mathcal{H}_2$ will depend on the steps taken. If you centered $\mathcal{H}_1$ initially, you might need to apply the inverse translation at the end if you want $\mathcal{H}_1$ back in its original relative position (though it will still be oriented).

**Formalism Summary:**

1.  **Represent the convex hulls by their vertex sets.**
2.  **For $\mathcal{H}_1$:**
- **(Optional)** Translate by $-c_1$ to center at the origin.
- Apply a rotation $R_1$ based on the desired orientation.
3.  **For $\mathcal{H}_2$:**
- Identify the target face on the transformed $\mathcal{H}_1$ ($\mathcal{H}''_1$).
- Identify the corresponding features on $\mathcal{H}_2$.
- Compute a rotation $R_2$ and translation $t$ that aligns these features. The method for computing $R_2$ and $t$ depends on the type of alignment (face-to-face, vertex-to-plane, vertex-to-vertex).
- Apply the transformation to the vertices of $\mathcal{H}_2$: $v'_{2,i} = R_2 v_{2,i} + t$.

**Mathematical Notation:**

* Vertices: $v \in \mathbb{R}^3$
* Centroid: $c \in \mathbb{R}^3$
* Translation: $T(v, t) = v + t$, where $t \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the translation vector.
* Rotation: $R(v, \Theta) = Rv$, where $R \in SO(3)$ is a 3x3 rotation matrix (determined by the axis of rotation and angle $\Theta$).
* Rigid Body Transformation: $g(v, R, t) = Rv + t$, where $R \in SO(3)$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}^3$.

**Example Scenario (Face-to-Face Alignment):**

1.  $\mathcal{H}_1$ is centered at the origin and oriented such that one of its face normals is aligned with the positive z-axis ($n_1 = [0, 0, 1]^T$). Let a vertex on this face be $p_1 = [x_1, y_1, z_1]^T$.
2.  $\mathcal{H}_2$ has a face with normal $n_2$ and a vertex $q_1$ on that face.
3.  Find a rotation $R_2$ that aligns $n_2$ with $[0, 0, 1]^T$.
4.  The translation vector $t = p_1 - R_2 q_1$ will bring the faces into contact at $p_1$.
5.  The transformed vertices of $\mathcal{H}_2$ are $v'_{2,i} = R_2 v_{2,i} + (p_1 - R_2 q_1)$.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Uniqueness:** The alignment might not be unique, especially if the shapes have symmetries. You might need additional constraints to specify a unique alignment.
* **Robustness:** The choice of features for alignment (faces, vertices) can impact the robustness of the process, especially in the presence of noise or imperfect data.
* **Computational Complexity:** Computing convex hulls and performing the alignment transformations can be computationally intensive, especially for complex shapes with many vertices.

This formalism provides a structured approach to the problem. The specific implementation details for finding the rotations and translations will depend on the exact criteria for alignment you have in mind. Good luck!

It looks like you make a subtle mistake. The rotation on the vertices in the original object reference frame would rotate the vertices away from their desired target. The mistake I see is that you should first move the object's centroid point to the origin, then do the rotation, and then translate the rotated version of the original origin vertex, v0, back to the origin. Rotations are around the origin and the convex hull is not centered on the origin, thus causing it to sweep into a new position that is not easy to interpret. Do you think that is a better formalism?

You are absolutely correct! My apologies for that oversight. Applying a rotation directly to a convex hull that is not centered at the origin will indeed result in a rotation around the world origin, leading to an unwanted translation. Your proposed formalism is much more robust and standard for rigid body transformations:

**Improved Formalism for Reorientation:**

1.  **Translate to Origin:** Find the centroid of the original convex hull and translate all vertices so that the centroid is at the origin.
2.  **Rotate:** Apply the desired rotation to the centered convex hull. This rotation will now occur about the intended center of the object.
3.  **Translate Back (Optional):** If you want a specific point of the original hull (like vertex v0) to return to the origin after rotation, you would translate the rotated hull by the negative of the rotated position of that specific original point (which was moved to the origin in step 1). However, if the goal is simply to orient the hull in the global space without a specific anchor at the origin, this step might be skipped.

In our specific case, since you want to align a face normal with a global direction and the example output for the first prism has one vertex at the origin, it seems the intent is to (implicitly) anchor a corner (likely the one that was originally at the origin if no explicit translation is mentioned).

Let's refine the steps for the first prism:

1.  **Centroid of the original prism:**

$$
c_1 = \frac{1}{8} ( (0,0,0) + (m,0,0) + (m,0,k) + (0,0,k) + (0,n,k) + (0,n,0) + (m,n,0) + (m,n,k) ) = (\frac{m}{2}, \frac{n}{2}, \frac{k}{2})
$$

2.  **Translate by $-c_1$:** Subtract the centroid from each vertex. For example, $v0' = v0 - c_1 = (-\frac{m}{2}, -\frac{n}{2}, -\frac{k}{2})$.

3.  **Rotate by $R_x(-90^\circ)$:** Apply the rotation to the translated vertices. For a vertex $v'' = R_x(-90^\circ) (v - c_1)$.

4.  **Translate back to anchor v0 at the origin:** The original v0 was at $(0,0,0)$. After the translation and rotation, its new position will be $R_x(-90^\circ) (0 - c_1) = R_x(-90^\circ) (-\frac{m}{2}, -\frac{n}{2}, -\frac{k}{2})^T$. To bring this rotated original v0 back to the origin, we need to apply a translation by the negative of this vector: $-R_x(-90^\circ) (-\frac{m}{2}, -\frac{n}{2}, -\frac{k}{2})^T = R_x(-90^\circ) (\frac{m}{2}, \frac{n}{2}, \frac{k}{2})^T$.

Let's compute this translation vector:

$$
R_x(-90^\circ) \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ n/2 \\ k/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ n/2 \\ k/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ -n/2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

So, the final transformation for each original vertex $v_i$ would be:

$$
v'_i = R_x(-90^\circ) (v_i - c_1) + \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ -n/2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Let's apply this to the original v0 = (0, 0, 0):

$$
v'_0 = R_x(-90^\circ) ( (0,0,0) - (\frac{m}{2}, \frac{n}{2}, \frac{k}{2}) ) + (\frac{m}{2}, \frac{k}{2}, -\frac{n}{2})
$$

$$
v'_0 = R_x(-90^\circ) (-\frac{m}{2}, -\frac{n}{2}, -\frac{k}{2})^T + (\frac{m}{2}, \frac{k}{2}, -\frac{n}{2})^T
$$

$$
v'_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -m/2 \\ -n/2 \\ -k/2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ -n/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -m/2 \\ -k/2 \\ n/2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ -n/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This correctly anchors the transformed original v0 at the origin.

Now let's apply this to another vertex, say v3 = (0, 0, k):

$$
v_3 - c_1 = (0 - m/2, 0 - n/2, k - k/2) = (-\frac{m}{2}, -\frac{n}{2}, \frac{k}{2})
$$

$$
R_x(-90^\circ) (v_3 - c_1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -m/2 \\ -n/2 \\ k/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -m/2 \\ k/2 \\ n/2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
v'_3 = \begin{bmatrix} -m/2 \\ k/2 \\ n/2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ -n/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ k \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This matches the v3' in your transformed vertices.

Let's try v2 = (m, 0, k):

$$
v_2 - c_1 = (m - m/2, 0 - n/2, k - k/2) = (\frac{m}{2}, -\frac{n}{2}, \frac{k}{2})
$$

$$
R_x(-90^\circ) (v_2 - c_1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ -n/2 \\ k/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ n/2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
v'_2 = \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ n/2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} m/2 \\ k/2 \\ -n/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} m \\ k \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This matches v2'.

It seems your intuition about centering and then translating back to anchor a specific point is correct and aligns with the output you provided.

**5. Transformation for the Second Prism**

The second prism undergoes the same reorientation. Let its original vertices be identical to the first prism (same dimensions, same local frame definition). It will be transformed using the same rotation and the same translation to anchor its original v0 at the origin *in its reoriented frame*. Then, it needs to be translated to the right of the first transformed prism by 1 grid point in the y-direction (global y-direction).

The translation for the second prism will be the same as the first to achieve the reorientation and anchoring, followed by an additional translation of $[0, k + 1, 0]^T$ if the "right" direction corresponds to the positive global y-axis and the dimension in that direction is $k$. However, looking at your transformed vertices for the second prism, the y-dimension is also $k$, and the relative shift in the y-direction between corresponding vertices of the two transformed prisms is indeed $k$. So, the additional translation for the second prism after reorientation and anchoring is $[0, k + 1, 0]^T$.

**Python Program**

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`rotate_x_minus_90()`:** Returns the 3x3 rotation matrix for a -90 degree rotation around the x-axis.
2.  **`transform_hull(vertices, m, n, k)`:**
- Takes the list of vertices and the dimensions of the prism as input.
- Calculates the centroid.
- Defines the rotation matrix.
- Defines the translation vector needed to anchor the original v0 at the origin after rotation.
- Iterates through each vertex:
- Centers the vertex by subtracting the centroid.
- Rotates the centered vertex.
- Translates the rotated vertex to the final position.
- Returns the list of transformed vertices.
3.  **Main part of the script:**
- Defines the dimensions `m`, `n`, and `k`.
- Defines the original vertices of the first prism.
- Calls `transform_hull` to get the transformed vertices of the first prism.
- Defines the original vertices of the second prism (same as the first).
- Calls `transform_hull` to get the reoriented and anchored vertices of the second prism.
- Applies an additional translation of `[0, k + 1, 0]` to the second prism to place it to the right of the first.
- Prints the transformed vertices of both prisms.
- Includes the expected output based on your example for comparison.

**Important Note on Expected Output:**

There might still be a slight difference in the order of vertices in the output compared to your example. The geometric relationship should be the same, but the order in which the vertices are listed might differ based on how the transformations are applied. The key is that the resulting oriented and positioned prisms match the geometric description.

This revised approach, incorporating the translation to the origin, rotation, and then translation back to anchor a specific point, is a much more controlled and predictable way to achieve the desired reorientation. Thank you for pointing out the crucial detail!
